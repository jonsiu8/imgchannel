It's the end of the year and we make all kinds of resolutions for the next year.  We want to lose weight, have better relationships, be wealthier, etc.

Yes, most of the time they don’t work but it doesn't mean you don't make new year's resolutions anymore.  **Resolutions are great because it means you want improvements in your life, it means you are hopeful and that's a beautiful thing.**

Most “resolutions” don't work because they're too general and maybe too grandiose.  **Make it more achievable with these few hints:**

* **Just make one resolution** - it’s easier to focus on one thing at a time and put all your effort to do it until it becomes a good habit
* **Use very clear and specific actions** - replace general ideas with definite actions. For example, instead of wishing to lose weight, say “*I will exercise 3 times a week for 30 mins per session.*” or “*I will only eat one cup of rice in any meal.*”  Instead of saying “*I want to be wealthy this year*”, say “*I will save 10% of my income and acquire new money management skills every week.*”
* **Don’t be too hard on yourself** - allow yourself to fail but don’t give up.  Nobody becomes an expert overnight, not even a year.  So just keep on going.

Making resolutions for the year ahead is excellent but of course you don’t need to wait for the new year to better yourself.  You can make improvements anytime but the new year is also a great time to start.  So continue to be hopeful and **create that new year’s resolution but do it right this time.**

***May you have a prosperous new year!***

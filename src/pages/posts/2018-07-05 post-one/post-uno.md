### This is why

"If you want to be wealthy, you should be in business." I often hear this advice by successful entrepreneurs and business people. But I wonder how this would make the employees feel. Pressured perhaps to be an entrepreneur or they may just accept the fact that they can never become wealthy.

Sure, business people and entrepreneurs can become wealthy, why not? there's enough business for everyone. But businesses need employees to help build their wealth for them. Team members and leaders run the business in their absence. Is there a chance for employees to become wealthy too?

Definitely YES! You can become wealthy if you want it bad enough and you don't have to be a business person or an entrepreneur to do it. Invest your time learning proper financial education. Study your options and know them well. I believe that the poorest person is the one without options. Use your spare time to learn and gain positive attitudes towards money.

Not everyone may have the personality or risk tolerance to be an entrepreneur but anyone can become wealthy, even employees.

To all entrepreneurs, thank you for taking the risks to be in business and for giving jobs to all your employees. I encourage you to take care of your people and provide them also the financial education they need. Remember, a financially happy employee is a more productive one.

Keep on working towards your dreams and keep on saving, every peso counts!
